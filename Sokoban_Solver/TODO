Use the move cost calculation in A-star (trivial, but remember to place the player at the correct position after reverse moves, eventually by replaying last move from trans table)
Create function to calculate player moves for each box move.
//there seems to be some bug where we generate incorrect move. Look at go_to_state, the bug is probably here.
